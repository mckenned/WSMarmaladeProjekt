															<p>Wash and dice the {{fruit}} and place it in a large pot. Then mix the jam sugar (1:3) into the pot. Cover with a cotton dish towel and let sit for 2 hours.
															Meanwhile, rinse the jars and lids thoroughly with hot water and lay them out for filling.
															After 2 hours, stir the fruit-sugar mixture well and place it the stove. Bring it to the boil for about 3 minutes, stirring occasionally. Then lower the temperature and add {{the spices}} to taste. Stir well again.
															Carefully fill the first jar with a ladle and a filling funnel, then immediately close it and place it upsidedown on a cloth. Repeat this with the other jars until all of the jam has been distributed to jars.
															After the glasses have cooled down slightly, place them right side up again to coll completely.
															Store the finished jam in a cool, dark place for up to a year.</p>
